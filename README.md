# 3D Chess Game

Welcome to my 3D Chess Game project! This is a personal project where Iâ€™m learning to build interactive 3D applications using Three.js. My goal is to combine the strategic depth of chess with the exciting visual appeal of 3D graphics to create a fun experience.

â™ž This project started as a design exercise a while ago as a 3D printing experiment where I designed and modeled each piece. As I worked on creating the physical models, I became obsessed with the idea of bringing them to life digitally.

I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ™‚

## Overview
In this project, I've implemented a fully interactive 3D chessboard, enabling players to enjoy a traditional chess game in a visually rich environment. This served as a learning platform where I can explore Three.js for 3D rendering, Webpack for bundling assets, and improve my skills in JavaScript development.


## Features
- Interactive 3D Chessboard: A fully functional 3D chessboard that you can interact with, powered by Three.js.
- Real-Time Rendering: Smooth and responsive animations for the chess pieces, thanks to WebGL and Three.js rendering.
- Customizable Visuals: You can modify textures, models, and the environment to personalize the game.

- Learning and Experimentation: This project is my learning journey in Three.js, Webpack, and modern JavaScript practices.

## WIP
This project is a work in progress as I continue learning. Hereâ€™s what I plan to work on next:

- Multiplayer Support: Adding online multiplayer functionality so users can play against each other.
- More Visual Customizations: Improving the 3D models, textures, and adding new environments.
- AI Integration: Developing an AI opponent for single-player mode.
